# PyXML - XFLR
Deprecated - Instead, use the default XML parser to parse files generated by XFLR5. Then call .reduce() on the root-most tag to contract all nested tags to attributes.

Before saving the file, call .expand() on all children of the root tag (or call root.expand() followed by root.reduce(1))

A basic python XML parser
